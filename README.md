Very simple small changable and configurable from PC pseudo operation system for control PCB with little microcontroller. 

This pseudo OS at present contains two modules - crontab and uart.
Crontab module allows change values of any sequence of memory cells in alarm time moment.
Uart module allows change values of any sequence of memory cells by writing them in any current time moment.
